An example landing page for an online hotel booking website. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use CSS flexbox to layout the web page UI, how to use `SVG` images and more. This project, same as the [05-natours](../05-natours) project, uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) language to write all styling code and then uses [Dart SASS compiler](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) to compile the `SASS` code to nomal `CSS` which can be understood by the web browsers.

## 3rd-Party Packages

The project uses the following 3rd-party [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) package

| Package | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) | `dev` | Compile `SASS` code (`.scss` files) to normal `CSS` code |
| [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) | `dev` | A little development server with live reload capability |
| [concat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concat) | `dev` | Concatenate multiple files |
| [autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) | `dev` | Parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) |
| [postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss) | `dev` | A tool named `PostCSS` which is used in combination with other plugins for transforming CSS styles. This project use `PostCSS` and `PostCSS CLI` to run `autoprefixer` plugin |
| [postcss-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-cli) | `dev` | CLI for running `PostCSS` |
| [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all) | `dev` | A CLI tool to run multiple npm-scripts in parallel or sequential |

## Source Code

Switch the source code to versions described below to view different implementations.

| Git Tag | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| [v6.0.0](https://github.com/TranXuanHoang/TheWeb/releases/tag/v6.0.0) | Create a landing page for an online hotel booking website using `CSS flex box` and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) |

## Run App

* Install `Node.js` dependencies with `npm install`
* Run app with `npm start`

## NPM Scripts

The [package.json](./package.json) files defines the following `npm scripts` which are used to build `SASS` code to `CSS` code, concat `CSS` files, prefix `CSS` rules to get support with more browsers and make final `CSS` code that are ready for production:

| npm script | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `watch:sass` | Compiles `SASS` code to `CSS` *with* **hot reload** - rerun whenever new changes are added |
| `devserver` | Opens a `live-server` as a web server to host the web app on your dev local machine |
| **`start`** | :computer: Runs all the above two scripts in parallel |
| `compile:sass` | :one: Compiles `SASS` code to `CSS` *without* **hot reload** - run only one time and done |
| `prefix:css` | :two: Uses `PostCSS` to run `Autoprefixer` to add vendor prefixes (i.e., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, ...) to `CSS` code in the `style.comp.css` file which was generated by the `compile:sass` script and outputs result in `style.prefix.css` file |
| `compress:css` | :three: Compresses all the `CSS` code in the `style.prefix.css` file into one single line eliminating redundant space characters and puts the result minifined `CSS` in `style.min.css` file |
| **`build:css`** | :rocket: Runs all the above three scripts one by one sequentially. Note that, this script will generate a `style.min.css` file, and this file needs to be linked with the `index.html` as a `stylesheet` resource<br> `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.min.css">` |
